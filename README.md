# Tello Pilot

This is a simple go program that allows you to control a DJI Tello drone using a gamepad.

This is for simple play purposes and is not intended for use or development as a product.
There are no plans for improvements to this project.

## Requirements

- A DJI Tello drone
- A gamepad (I use a Xbox One controller)
- A computer with a wifi adapter
- FFmpeg installed and in your PATH (use ffplay for video streaming)

## Usage

1. Connect your computer to the Tello drone's wifi network
2. Run the program
